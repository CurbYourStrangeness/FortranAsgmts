Write a program to read the records in the file STUDENT.DAT (see Appendix B) for the structure of the data. 
It will store them in an array of Structures, sort them so that they are in ascending order of Student Number using selection sort. 
The program will ask the user to enter a student number. 
If the student number is found it will then display that student number, names, total credits, GPA and major of the record. 
If it is not found it will print a message that the input student number was not found. 
It will repeat this until -1 is entered as the student number. 
The program will then ask the user for the Honor Roll file name. 
It will then write to this file all the student records who have a GPA of 3.50 or higher in the same structure as the STUDENT.DAT file. 
Lastly, it will close both files.
